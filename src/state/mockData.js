// players hitting per basic strategy, dealer standing on 17) and pasted
// in below, so it reads like real blackjack. They were picked so the
// running count since the shuffle, including the current hand's visible
// cards, comes out to +3. Cards are

// first card, dealer hole card, each player's second card, then every
